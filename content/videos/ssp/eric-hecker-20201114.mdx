In Part 3, we talked about Eric's time in Antarctica and discussed other things. We also had a visit from a child alter of mine for about 15 minutes. [I'm having more obvious incursions of alters the past few weeks. I have no control over that, so be patient.]

Eric Hecker is a researcher and experiencer born on Long Island in New York. He was targeted at a young age for the STARGATE program presumably because he scored very highly on the standardized testing at the time. He has very clear memories of his Monroe Institute training. He later joined the Navy and was selected for the Submarine Service. This was the first time he crossed paths with Raytheon. After a very brief "training period" in the Sub Service, Eric became a Plumber working at some of the most exclusive, odd, and remote places on the planet. He even spent an entire year at the South Pole Station.

Now Eric lives in Alaska where he has continued to work in an array of remote sites. He is also working in the community to try and help folks make connections with their own past as well as his own. You can follow his work on both YouTube and MeWe at DecipheringMyExperience.
