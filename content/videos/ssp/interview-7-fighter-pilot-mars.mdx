PENNY BRADLEY (interview 7) - SERVING AS A FIGHTER PILOT ON MARS (50 min.)

In this interview Penny is giving a fascinating account about her service in Marsische Heimschild - the German militia on Mars - as a member of an all-female pilot unit called the Valkyries. The interview goes into a number of different topics:

- What kind of technological enhancements did the pilots have?

- What capabilities and weapons were the battle craft equipped with?

- What were Penny's duties and some of the incidents that happened during service?

- Which local Martian races did Penny encounter?

- How did the Martian environment affect the flying missions?

And many more!
