Eric Hecker and I are announcing that we are going to try to find a new way to give information to the public. In case you are not aware, the gatekeepers of the UFO community are not welcoming SSP veterans or supersoldiers with our memories of space service. The UFO community is embracing the Consciousness community's concept that all the memories are a normal part of consciousness development rather that being the real memories of real events in 3D in this timeline.

Also, I have discovered that nearly all conferences expect the speakers to pay their own way and to not be paid for speaking. [Only the headline speakers get paid.] I'm sure the folks who pay the high prices to attend are not aware of that.

So Eric and I are working on another path. We will be meeting in Anchorage Alaska the second week of July to brainstorm this. So look forward to what we come up with--it will at least be different.
