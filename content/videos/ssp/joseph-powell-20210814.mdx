Right before we went to air, one of the other folks in the community decided to declare Joseph Powell "a triple agent". My producer Darrell Neely, aka Odin responds to that in the first few minutes. Joseph is a real SSP veteran and is as valid as anyone else who was actually there. I have served with him myself, I'm not taking anyone else's word for it.

So, we talked about his newer memories. For those of you who wonder, remembering is an ongoing process, especially when you have multiple alters serving in different factions. Each faction has it's own propaganda and brainwashing--and it's difficult to get past all that to look objectively at the memories. [Some veterans never accomplish that.] He will probably continue to remember new events and details for a long time.

Think about what happened in your life when you were young. The memories I usually discuss took place when I was 4, and I served a 55-and-back and was returned to age 4 and now I'm 65 looking back on it. Joseph's memories start with events when he was 14, and various 20-and-backs with Solar Warden. Plus the trip I was on with him was a 60-and-back with Nacht Waffen. When you are dealing with recovering memories from that long ago, it is a process, not an all-at-once thing.

In spite of the unnecessary stress, I think we did a good job and this is worth the time to listen to it.

Joseph W. Powell is an Empath who was inducted into an MK ultra program in 1997-1998 at the age of eight while attending The Desert Adventist Academy. He served in Solar Warden, The Ashtar Galactic Command & Nacht Waffen.

Joseph is available on FB.
