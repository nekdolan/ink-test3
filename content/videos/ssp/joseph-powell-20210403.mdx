TRIGGER ALERT:We got into some serious stuff in this one. This is not for sensitive types.

Joseph started with his introduction into the Chair and being inserted into bodies already on site. His first 'mission' was to serve the Satanist we know from Tony Rodrigues' testimony. He described in painful detail what was done to him and what was required of him. And how he came back through the Chair and killed the man and his family.

Then Joseph proceeded to discuss the ship he commands and how he felt being my commanding officer. Yes, the one I blew his head up. [Funny how that works sometimes.] And how he hates Draco and hated that I was SS and had drank the black goo. And about how he ended his service on the ship . . . .He's not dead, he is relieved of duty.

This session was not on air, so we went a bit over time. The sound is a bit better, and I did not shift alters as many times as he did.

Joseph W. Powell is an Empath who was inducted into an MK ultra program in 1997-1998 at the age of eight while attending The Desert Adventist Academy. He served in Solar Warden, The Ashtar Galactic Command & Nacht Waffen.
