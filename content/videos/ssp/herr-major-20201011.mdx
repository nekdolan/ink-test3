Herr Major works in law enforcement and cannot be public, but wanted to share the memories he has of serving with Penny Bradley for 15 years. We did Intelligence Gathering for Nacht Waffen by posing as smugglers in the region of space with der Bund colonies and outposts. You will find he is not always flattering of Penny.

That particular alter of Penny's started off in Kruger Mercenary faction as a fighter pilot and sensor array mechanic and transferred to Herr Major's ship 5 years into her 20-and-back for that alter. The change in faction created the issues that Herr Major complains about.
