When I invited Tony, I told him that I didn’t want to do the blow-by-blow history that most interviewers want from us, that I wanted this to be a conversation between friends about our services, about the reaction of the public, the current blowback against the whole topic by social media. Eric Hecker asked to join us, and it turned out great.

Tony Rodrigues is one of the only SSP whistleblowers who can verify any of his story—the parts on Earth where he was a sex slave to a Satanist cult. Tony and I have known each other since the time that we both went public in 2016—he was looking for counseling and ended up a star on Gaia.com and one of the major speakers in our community. He was never meant to serve in space, and the fact that he remembers doing so is incredible. I feel really honored that he agreed to come on my show.

Background, Tony is married with children, works in construction and drives a motorcycle. He does all these interviews basically as public talk therapy, because there still are not counselors for SSP veterans.

Eric Hecker is a researcher and experiencer born on Long Island in New York. He was targeted at a young age for the STARGATE program presumably because he scored very highly on the standardized testing at the time. He has very clear memories of his Monroe Institute training. He later joined the Navy and was selected for the Submarine Service. This was the first time he crossed paths with Raytheon. After a very brief "training period" in the Sub Service, Eric became a Plumber working at some of the most exclusive, odd, and remote places on the planet. He even spent an entire year at the South Pole Station.
