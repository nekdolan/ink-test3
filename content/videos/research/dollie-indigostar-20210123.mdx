We teased ahead of time that we were going to discuss "the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" of the Anunnaki both of history and their modern day ETs who call themselves Zha.a.mi. My producer Odin joined the conversation when Dollie had internet issues. We met in the Annuna community before I was public. Dollie has done MASSIVE amounts of research. We meant this one to be a conversation instead of an interview.

Dollie Indigostar is a Ancient Civilizations Theorist. She is a lifelong ET experiencer and ran 5 of the top sites for Ancient Civilizations. Dollie is an accredited anomaly hunter. She has been in multiple documentaries about space and life in the universe.
