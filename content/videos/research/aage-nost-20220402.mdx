Aage Nost has an extensive collection of historical photos on his website, but in this discussion he only shared two. We talked about how reality is actually constructed, and made references to Quantum Mechanics. He discussed how HE time travels, and shared screenshots from his computer from times he had been doing psychic time travel--much like remote viewing. Somehow he was able to have it come up on his monitor.Y'all know we talked about a lot of other things too.
