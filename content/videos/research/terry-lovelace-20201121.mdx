Note: I was having a REALLY hard time with alters shifting for about 6 months after my trip to Alaska that year. Terry was a really good sport about it and I love him for it.

Terry Lovelace served six years on active duty in the USAF from 1973 to 1979. He went on to complete a four year degree in psychology and earn a law degree from Western Michigan. His legal career included private practice and civil service as an Assistant Attorney General for the US Territory of American Samoa and later for the State of Vermont. He waited until retiring from the law to publish Incident at Devils Den, the true story of his 1977 abduction from an Arkansas State Park.

For wrap-up: Incident at Devils Den is available on Amazon as a Paperback, Audiobook and Kindle. Complete with x-rays and photographs it may be the best documented case of alien abduction in a decade.

His latest book is "Devils Den, the Reckoning".https://www.amazon.com/Terry-Lovelace-Esq/e/B07BDMYSHJ/
