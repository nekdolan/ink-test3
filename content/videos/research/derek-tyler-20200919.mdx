Note: We had an unexpected and unexplained sound lapse. We could not recover that. Derek and I did not know that this was happening and kept talking. Also, we did not conduct an interview. This was a chat between friends on air.

He is a best selling author of Alien Contact: The Difficult Truth series on Amazon.
