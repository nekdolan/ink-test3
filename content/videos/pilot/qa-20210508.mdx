My scheduled guest got kicked by a horse, and the man who had just contacted me this week was out when we called. The solution was to talk about the repetitive issues that have been coming up over the last 6 months. Oh, I cuss a little more than usual in this one.

There are folks in the community who seem to think that stepping on me is how to get ahead. The same folks can't keep their story straight. But they use military jargon, so they are 'credible'. And I'm an old woman so not. But the CIA data entry clerk verified my story and not theirs . . . .

I'm military in space. I'm an assassin on Earth. Seriously. Why do people think I would know about their religious questions? Should be enough said, but it won't be.

I am taken for service with both the CIA and the Germans in my 3D physical body. They broke my shoulder returning me 2 years ago, it required a 4 hour surgery. 3D physical in this timeline. Should be enough said, but it won't be.

I can never get to the cool stuff out there because the public can't get past their disbelief that this is somehow woo-woo instead of real. I've been at this nearly 5 years [NOW 7 YEARS]. I've been attacked by agents, I've been shot at with energy weapons, somehow I'm still here. And some of you won't believe me until I am killed. [Middle finger to those folks--you can die first.]

Am I angry? No. I'm frustrated and disappointed in the public. But if I go dark, the CIA will kill me cause the spotlight will be off. And in the meantime, they continue to kidnap and mind fracture more kids. And THAT is the whole point of me talking at all.

Thank you much to Odin for talking with me in this one.
