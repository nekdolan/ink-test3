Doris C. Neely is a retired CIA data entry clerk who spent her career entering people's "packets" into the memory banks of the CIA computer system and working in their Archive of the original documents. She came to talk with me about my packet that she herself entered into this system. Because of the rules, she had me talk about what I remembered and asked me questions to direct the 'story' to things she remembered from my file. It came out that an alter of mine had worked in the building until the alter's death--so she knew a version of me. In part of the interview, she comments about talking to me when the me she knew was dead.

This is important because she verifies the main parts of my testimony that I have been public with since September 2016.

This is an upload of the only copy of this radio show. The first 25 minutes were lost permanently. The sound is not great, but you should be able to hear it all. There was massive interference in this recording. This is not a studio production, but rather was 2 people on the ends of a phone internet connection.
