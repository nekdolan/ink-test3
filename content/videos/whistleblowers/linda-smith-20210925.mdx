Linda Smith has a new book about her life-long ET and UFO interactions out and I was honored to do one of her first interviews about it. We talked about the ETs. We talked about our genetic history based on DNA studies. We talked about her experiences, she shared photographs of the markings they left on her body. Linda is a friend real world and we chatted about how our children have responded to their own experiences. Richard joined us when we were talking about the Love Bite aspects.

Bio:As a third-generation experiencer, Linda’s earliest recollection of any extraterrestrial contact took place almost fifty five years ago at the age of three when she found herself face to face with two small beings standing in the hallway of her home. Linda’s family is no stranger to alien contact or UFO phenomena either. Her maternal grandmother, Florence, had an unexplained scoop mark on her leg since childhood. Her sister, Michele, had a first-time experience around the age of four and Linda’s children have had experiences spanning the last twenty-six years, making them the fourth generation in her family to have inherited what started with her grandmother and continued with her own mother, Ruth.
