Will Glover and I have alters serving on the same ship. Matt Tracy does not, but Matt and Will have alters who are serving the Draco Empire together. The three of us have been friends for some time now, and got together to share for your benefit. We discussed service in Nacht Waffen and with the Draco, and why the men's unit is now considered "rogue".

NOTE: Matt Tracy's internet is shared with several other folks and is intermittent because of that. He finally turned off the video so he could keep the sound.
